                        <em>Purpose:</em><br />
                        On a span of 2 years, I worked myself up from being a team member in the Baker Street branch of Nando’s to a Crew Trainer and soon as a manager.
                        As a manager, I'm in charge of making sure that the restaurant runs smoothly. General responsibilities include running shifts through delegation and organisation. Making sure that every customer walking in through that door is welcomed and given the best service.
                        <br /><br />
                        <em>Key Responsibilities:</em><br />
                        Responsibilities also include, being in charge of cash and banking. Making sure that the right procedures are followed. I've also been responsible for stock related duties.
                        <br /><br />
On top of that, I’ve also been in charge of the restaurant’s rota, making sure that every shift runs smoothly, by having the right people at the right time and within the restaurant’s budget. I’ve also ran the crew training team for the restaurant, making sure that the trainers have the right skills and equipment to train new members of staff, as well as all the other stuff when new policies and regulations occur.
<br /><br />
I've also been in charge of the restaurant's marketing duties. Making sure that the restaurant is ready for any occasion. From collaterals to restaurant decorations. Deals with nearby businesses, companies and universities have also been made in order to attract more customers.
